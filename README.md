Human trajectory prediction is a crucial task in understanding human behaviours. The random nature of human movements, from lower-level steering to high-level affective states, dictates that uncertainty estimation is vital in prediction, which consists of data and model uncertainty. However, existing deep learning methods either only capture the data uncertainty or mix the data and model uncertainties. To model these two uncertainties explicitly and investigate their relative importance in prediction, we propose a novel Bayesian differentiable physics model that decouples them. Our model captures the data uncertainty by a new Bayesian explicit physical model, and the model uncertainty by an implicit model. Given that there is no clear separation between the two uncertainties in the data, we design a proper training scheme to enable both uncertainties to capture the ideal randomness. Finally, we use Bayesian inference to incorporate prior knowledge of human behaviours. Through comprehensive evaluation, our model demonstrates strong explainability with fine-grained uncertainty modelling. In addition, it also outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy by up to 60.17% on public datasets SDD and ETH/UCY.

## Get Started
### Dependencies
Below is the key environment under which the code was developed, not necessarily the minimal requirements:  
  
 1 Python 3.8.8  
 2 pytorch 1.9.1  
 3 Cuda 11.1  
  
And other libraries such as numpy.  
### Prepare Data  
Raw data: SDD (https://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/uav_data/) and ETH/UCY (https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/aess/dataset/)  
Algorithms in data/SDD_ini can be used to process raw data into training data and testing data. The training/testing split is same as Y-net.  

### Training  
We employ a progressive training scheme. Run trainFa.py, trainFnFs_FixFa.py and train_CVAE.nsp to train the actuation block, the Neighbour Block with parameters of the scene context and CVAE, respectively. The outputs are saved in saved_models.
For example  
`python trainFa.py                                                                                `
